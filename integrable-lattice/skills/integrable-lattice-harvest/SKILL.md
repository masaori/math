# Integrable Lattice Harvest

## Goal

Collect a broad but traceable paper set for the `integrable-lattice` project. The output is not a bibliography; it is raw material for statement extraction.

## Required Context

Before deciding queries or scope, read:

- `integrable-lattice/README.md`
- `integrable-lattice/inputs/seeds/models.md`
- `integrable-lattice/inputs/seeds/operations.md`
- `integrable-lattice/inputs/seeds/axes.md`
- `integrable-lattice/inputs/queries/seed-queries.md`

## Workflow

1. Identify the target slice: model family, operation type, boundary condition, parameter regime, or seed paper.
2. Expand search phrases from the seed files. Preserve exact phrases for reproducibility.
3. Collect metadata from stable sources first: arXiv, DOI pages, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, publisher pages.
4. Prefer arXiv records when available because later extraction can use LaTeX source.
5. Record enough metadata to deduplicate papers: title, authors, year, arXiv id, DOI, URL, abstract, source availability.
6. Save curated query strings under `integrable-lattice/inputs/queries/`.
7. Save harvested metadata under `integrable-lattice/inputs/corpus/` when it is small and curated. For large corpora, save only manifest/query instructions.

## Output Shape

Use this minimal record shape in markdown, YAML, JSON, or JSONL:

```yaml
id:
title:
authors:
year:
source:
arxiv_id:
doi:
url:
abstract:
model_hints:
operation_hints:
source_available:
notes:
```

## Guardrails

- Do not call a paper relevant only because it contains generic terms like "integrable" or "lattice"; connect it to at least one seed model or operation.
- Do not judge novelty here. Mark only retrieval facts and coarse relevance.
- Keep failed or noisy queries when they explain search coverage.
